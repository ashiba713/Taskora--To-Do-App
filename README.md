Taskora is a minimalist productivity application designed to help users plan, prioritize, and actually complete tasks without feeling overwhelmed.
Instead of showing endless lists, Taskora focuses on clarity, calmness, and completion.

✨ Philosophy

Most to-do apps fail because they:

Show everything at once

Encourage task dumping

Create guilt instead of progress

Taskora’s belief:

Overwhelm is a design problem, not a user problem.

Taskora limits what you see, helps you decide what matters now, and gently encourages completion.

🎯 Core Goals

Reduce cognitive overload

Encourage task completion

Keep the experience fast, simple, and motivating

🚀 Features
➕ Smart Task Entry

Add tasks quickly with optional due dates

Clean input experience (auto-clears after adding)

🗂 Automatic Task Organization

Tasks are automatically categorized into:

Today → tasks due today

Upcoming → tasks with future dates

Someday → tasks without a due date

Users never need to manually organize tasks.

🌙 Someday Bucket

Holds ideas, goals, and non-urgent tasks

Keeps them safe but out of daily focus

Reduces guilt and clutter

✅ Task Completion

Mark tasks as completed

Completed tasks disappear from active views

Simple, distraction-free interaction

🧠 Why Taskora is Different

No forced productivity pressure

No complex dashboards

No unnecessary features

Taskora behaves like a calm personal assistant, not a task police officer.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python

Streamlit

Uses Streamlit Session State for in-memory task handling

Note: Tasks persist during the session. Persistence (database/file storage) can be added later.

▶️ How to Run the App
1. Install dependencies
pip install streamlit

2. Run Taskora
streamlit run app.py


The app will open automatically in your browser.

📌 How Task Categorization Works
Category	Rule
Today	Due date = today
Upcoming	Due date is in the future
Someday	No due date
📈 Future Enhancements (Planned)

Priority levels (Low / Medium / High)

Focus mode (single-task view)

Weekly review for Someday tasks

Task persistence (database / file)

Smart reminders and insights
